        Schooling
      </h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        From 2011 to 2018, I attended Florida State University where I went from
        being a pre-med student to being a Chemical Engineering graduate. I
        remember being in the engineering school from 7am to 9pm almost every
        day from my junior year to when I graduated. But it wasn't until after
        graduating that I realized that I didn't like Engineering as much as I
        thought I would, and that while I appreciated the challenge and loved
        learning, I really missed coding like I had done in school.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Finally, after two years of working as a construction estimator, I
        decided to enroll at Flatiron Denver to learn how to become a software
        engineer. There I felt that the skills I learned prepared me for a
        lifelong journey and pursuit of technological knowledge.

        Employment
      </h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        After college, I moved straight to Colorado from Florida, knowing full
        well that I'm the type to take a painful hike over a relaxing day at the
        beach. At first the job hunt was tough, but after a couple of
        hard-working months I landed a job as an estimator for powerline
        construction company called Great Southwestern construction. What I
        loved about the job was that it gave me the opportunity to learn about
        the construction industry, the bidding process of high dollar government
        jobs, and most importantly practical coding. While I worked there, I was
        able to occasionally solve company problems using Visual Basic.

        Hobbies
      </h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        When I am not coding, or learning about software, I really enjoy making
        music. In College, I founded an Audio Production club that is still
        running to this day, I produced for a local Tallahassee record label,
        and even performed in a band. I play guitar, bass, and piano and listen
        to all types of music. As well as music, I try to get out and exercise
        by mountainbiking, hiking, and rock climbing. After all, I did move out
        to Colorado for a reason!.
